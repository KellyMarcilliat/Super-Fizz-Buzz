# Super-Fizz-Buzz
Turing SFB Project

Project consists of implementation and test files for SuperFizzBuzz as well as an implementation script to allow directed play from the command line.  Four iterations integrated into the project: 1) simple script implementing SuperFizzBuzz on divisors 3, 5, and 7 and across a range of 1-1000.  2) implementation within a class and method structure, 3) Minitest implementation, and 4) CLI.

The functionality I have integrated into this game includes:
- ability for player to choose divisors
- conditional execution in the event 0 is chosen as a divisor
- ability for player to choose range
- conditional execution in the event the player enters a high-end number that is actually lower than the low-end

The game is set for expansion to an environment where game asks player to see if they can determine which divisor is generating the words: "Super", "Fizz", and "Buzz" respectively.

Note:  Since I began this game with a TDD approach, in a sense, I have skipped iteration 1.
